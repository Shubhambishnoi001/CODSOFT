# CODSOFT Task
For My Artificial Intelligence internship, I completed 3 tasks  for successful completion for the internship.
***
## Task 01
I Build a **simple chatbot** that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. I Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural
language processing and conversation flow.

## Task 02 
I Implement an **AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe**
against a human player.useing algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project help to understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.

## Task 03
I Create a **simple recommendation system** that suggests items to
users based on their preferences.useing techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
